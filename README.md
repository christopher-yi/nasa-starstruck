## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST API
Different types of media are pulled form NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. The about section's media is selected from a random date from June 16, 1995 to the present date. Similarly, the Random section's media is retrived from a random date using the "Lift Off" button. The Explore take in a date a returns the image or video for the date selected.

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to practice and become more familiar with API usage through the process of appending DOM elements with the data that was returned from using the Fetch API. Using Javascript, I was also able to manipulate the range of dates that the data would be pulled from. Additionally, I accounted for dates that do not provide any media.
